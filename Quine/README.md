# A quine is a computer program which takes no input and produces a copy of its own source code as its only output. The standard terms for these programs in the computability theory and computer science literature are "self-replicating programs", "self-reproducing programs", and "self-copying programs".


- Run the following command line instructions:
    1. javac quine.java
    2. java quine > output.txt
- The above commands will create and save a file "output.txt" with the output of the code.
- The source code and the output must be an exact match for this quine.
